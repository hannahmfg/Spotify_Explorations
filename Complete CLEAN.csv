Oh
Love
Love, love, love, love (sex)
Love, love, love, love (sex)
This one don't frown when I'm the wrong
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised this all I know
I felt the highs and they felt like you
See a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl I'm so in love with you
Girl I'm so in love with you
Yeah, yeah
Baby you were everything I ever wanted
Bottle, wedding ring it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away
So I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college
I was on the phone, we ain't no talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh
I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargin
Mr. Charmin' that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hemp for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said ""all you ever think about is sex""
I'm like oh well
You know me so well
And if this will make you lay I swear I won't tell
And every time I call your phone you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail
Well I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass what Heaven's like
When I'm in that pussy it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
That's my only chance, I better get it right
Take your time my baby
Cause I'm waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
But yes I'm waitin' right here for you, for you
You get closer with me run away
All I ever know is the color gray
Your loving ways bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you
But now you're in my world
In my world, ah

Hello I would like to tell you about my love affair
With my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other
And find out about each other
We got to know each other little by little living very close in the same building
And he would help me with things and I would see him and think ""what a cute guy""
And he was a cute guy
And it was just little by little we got to know
Just to say hello
One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him
People respected him, and he was good to everybody
He knew people he worked with all adored him
And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody
For me was the most important
Being attracted to him and being, finding people respected him and I respected him
I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were
And I learned to understand and respect
And see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time
So it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together
And our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other
And the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other
After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding
With just family and very close friends
The friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys
And, my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys
And I feel I just gave him a wonderful life
A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too
And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other",500960

Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made
I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase

Told me ""Money has changed you""

There was a time that I believed that

It's a problem, I need a wake up
Before one morning I don't wake up
You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya
I'm too obsessed with going down as a great one
And if you wait too long, they go find someone to replace ya

I love you more than words could express
And this the part that Q start crying, if he ain't already yet

I don't know who I am, I'm so good at doing impressions though
I'm going to the festival, the festival need to let me go
I wake up, pop a couple Benadrylls, go back to sleep
So I made up, everything they said was real, it has to be
Cause actually the master fast asleep
And the castles back back in his private quarters
That's a master for you, this a revolution, we don't have no order
All this torture, thought I had to warn you
Leave it all behind and go to California
I'm past the signs, it's the real thing, try analyzing this feeling
You can't fathom
My hands are ahead the clouds
From the clap-clap thunder looking down
While you're running around
I lift you up when you drown
Unlock the mission, the planet in rotation
Full speed chasing and you're always running ahead
You're always running ahead
You got second chances, happy birthday, sweet romances
And you paddle like a duckling, why
Don't wanna go, don't wanna go, don't wanna go to the festival
You got angels, we can see them dripping from the sky
You watch 'em with your third eye
Don't wanna go, don't wanna go, don't wanna go to the festival

Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure, find the perfect style
Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love

I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet
I think I'm JFK's final speech
They try assassinating all of my beliefs
But I'm asleep so whisper to me for some peace of mind
And he be high some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine
Twenty thousand on my watch cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine
Can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it's just not the same
I'm looking my window ashing on the pane

Don't you ever wanna hide away
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today
I'll greet the devil with a smilin' face

She fuck me and swallowed every homie I came with
MCM bag and nigga, bet some weed in it
200 dollars worth of Backwoods, we all living
Brought the gangsters back to bucket hat, how real is that?
I'm getting money, rub my tummy, that's my baller sack
Quarter million in a safe in case I get a case
Faggot-ass judge hating on me cause my money straight
Dropped 10 racks in all 50 states
Gone name my next tour Million-Man March
Make a nun throw it back while I pull her scarf
She gave me head, my nuts touched her cross, boss

But can't you see? This angel speaks
She's saying the place is safe for me
I told ""wait or me, "" the make believer normally disguise

All the time we all behind, get lost in this Aquarium
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria
Confessions that I have and curiosity about life and death
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest
Read about the meaning of dreaming and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes
We all in search for substance, that gives you pain and numbness
Circumstances advance the second chances, for this beloved
I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this coming
But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrows trend
Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained
Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days
Life, it works in such mysterious ways

No clue what I'm callin' my album
Fans be at my pants, screamin', callin' me Malcolm
Never knew the outcome be this much cash, now
Bank account lookin' like a George Young stash house
Youngin' actin' out and topics that I rap about be very big if to politics to bitches pullin' asses out
That's exactly how I do this as a rapper,
I'm nuttin' in her mouth, you tongue kissin' her after
Daughters, moms kinda want me, neuter
But they also want the kid to come right on they cooter
Have the music sounding better than guitar tuners
Plus I'm doin' shows daily, call me John Stewart
So, who you know is iller than Mac Miller and Company?
It's like I planted money seeds right underneath the fuckin' tree

Yeah, I said it publicly, so run and tell your mother, mother fucker.
I said run and tell your mother, mother fucker.

In deep, did a hundred songs, and that's this week
Shit keeps going on and on
We just tryna go bananas like its Donkey Kong, Yeah
On my grind, always need to work
So I be eatin' good, you be eatin' dirt
If you talkin' shit, you gon' see me smirk
While the DJ's be scratchin' 'til the needles burst
A couple screws prolly loose in my head
Holla at my girl, tell her to bring that doobie to bed
I'm a regular guy within a regular life
Except I'm a Lamborghini if it's racing a bike
Who knew, that I could turn, turn sound into something so cool
Fresh kids see me I am bustin' dope moves
Comin', and soon, do a D-turn and view
Creep in your kitchen, start ea-ting your food
Girls tryna fuck, I don't be in the mood
No time for pussy when my knee in the room
Ooh, I switch flows switch rhythm
Sick spittin', unlimited ammunition.

See, I-I-I been buyin' these diamonds
All designer clothes and a Benz just to drive in
Autograph signin' must've got to my head

Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit
So make a toast to the good life
Hey, hey, ten thousand dollar hands, billion dollar plan
Listenin' to jams while I'm sittin' in my van
This is who I am, wrote these lyrics on my DNA code
Happy as hell, MDMA, yo!
Fuck a job, there ain't no one that I call my boss
We just tryna work so we can blow up like a molotov
And it kinda wake me up like a coffee shop
Thinkin' bout my people who was murdered in the Holocaust
Got me thankful just for life by itself
And there's way more people here I should be tryna to help
Am I wrong for spendin' money how I do, probably yes
It's just funny old people see the logo on my chest
You got ya thumb held high, we can be friends
Other people pretend, we hang out on the weekends
These fuckers lil' bit creepy, so we just leave them

Welcome to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Looking out my monocle
I'm dodging obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cockroach, I'm heroin cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and fucking shiny word to Mop and Glo
Tryin' to get a mansion ain't nobody here gonna find my room
Money gonna be green I guarantee you that my socks stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day these losers always goin' with what's trendy

All City Champion everybody is second string
No need to testify (testify) for the best is I (best is I)

Hundred different shoes to fill no need to cop a fresher pair

Fool you better get prepared
Don't know 'bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market where we kicking out the garbage
Sick bars I've been a boss so stick around and watch it
Did the round, no college campus chilling writing on top of planet Earth
Fuck who's first, it's just bout who the hardest
On my own two, fuck whose saying different
Every time I rhyme I get that Punxsutawney feeling
I'm the starter you the fill in
You a martyr I'm just killing
Getting harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin' it and goin' in
Don't call me Malcolm if you didn't fuckin' know me then
And if you lonely girl I could be your only friend
You got some shit to say I suggest you hold it in

On the map, illest city out, I guess that's just a fact
I'ma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball

A part of me want to chill, but a part of me want to win
No college paying my bills, I'm saying just what it feels

One day you gonna make it
If they gave you hand out, and you were down, babe, would you take it?

We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late
I'mma make my way to the top, every day I get closer

And turned a cold shoulder to me
And now they want tickets to my shows for free
Hey man, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?
Bitch suck my dick

The hate ain't gonna last forever, so I just smile, it's whatever
Under the weather shit'll get better
Under the weather shit'll get better
Don't let anybody say you can't, heart beatin like the 808

Fuckin' girls but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of drugs that enter in my brain

Police tryna to figure out how to get me locked up

Work four bars that are tighter than your corn rows
See a girl that's lookin' horny in the fourth row

Dontist, manipulating phonics, put em into sonnets

Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy
No methamphetamine's, hot, hundred and ten degrees
Visually stunnin', gotta see it on the LED
When I was seventeen I thought I had it figured out
Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route
It's crucial, three new schools, life with a spoonful
Of sugar, yea I need my medicine
Fuckin' Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president
Represent all these fuckin' people that I never met
Some expect me to be the greatest ever
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever

Got this rap shit down to a science
My Louis belt way nicer than Orion's, confined to an assignment
You won't finish in the kitchen, like appliance
Is just a mothafuckin' kid, say my head is gettin' big
No that's my ego, trippin' somewhere where they need a ski-slope
Rockin' in the fall like a pea-coat, freaks with a deep throat
Students run the class, y'all should keep notes
Drunk then I'm hard to understand, Don Vito
Ace in the Casino, I'm Robert DeNiro
I be low, key though, Young Nino with my jeans low
Your girl love it when I speak slow, she go (ahh)
You can hear the way she's moaning
Started back at midnight, had it 'til the morning
Wake up with some morning wood
Hit it before work, yeah I'm sure she would
All my female fans like, ""I'm sure it's good""
I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground
Shorty come and kick it at the swings
I'm way too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Cops comin', muthafucker stay down
Girl I'll be waitin' at the swings",173516

You keep startin' fights
Think you always right
Call you up to tell you I ain't comin' home tonight
Say you wanna leave me
It's just talkin' but I know you might
Now get along, now get along, now go
You sing along, now every song you know
You play your part, I'm playin' mine
You breakin' hearts, ain't breakin' mine
Since growing old is taking time
I'm acting like I'm eight or nine
Tryin' to move on, talking to my old friends
See me, say what up and I'm actin' like I don't know them
Causing so much problems, why you doin' that, doin' that
Ripping people's hearts out, you to cute for that, cute for that
I've been on the same shit
We run into each other and it's like
We don't even speak the same language
I guess people always going through changes
Didn't think I would lose you once I got famous
Said baby I got missed calls and emails
All going into details
About how you just not happy
And you think you gotta leave so
Go, go
I'll be fine on my own, own
Said baby I got missed calls and emails
All going into details
'Bout how you used to love me
I keep changing like the leaves, hell
Go, go
You'll be fine on your own, own
She tell me, ""You an asshole, superficial douchebag
Wishing that you knew that, you could have these shoes back
Of all of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back
All the shit you buy me""
She said, ""I want you back
I can't be seen again with you and all of your friends
It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when
I thought you used to be the one
I guess you don't have time
'Cause all you do is grind and it's got me loose my mind
You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to
Think I'm bout to lose you""
I'mma end this now before things just confuse you
Kept breakin' promises you said you keep

Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about

When the cops drove by his house, so who you tryin' to dial

And to the man in the hat standing lookin' at his watch
Motherfucker, well the time is now
Go clap your hands, let me hear you say, ""That's the jam""
See I wouldn't be shit if I ain't have no fans
Can't sit down kids you have to stand
Just put your hands up, you don't have to dance
Here, we get it poppin' like it's Pakistan
Iraq, Iran, and have them sayin' Mac's the man
The maximum, coming through to pass you bums
So if you ain't got no money better ask for some
Hey, we came to get down, have a good time
Bring the champagne out and the good wine
We gon' be sippin' and whippin' the sickest whips
Spittin' the illest shit that's sicker than syphilis
Comin' in the back door yellin', ""Fuck a list""
Fans takin' pictures while I'm tryin' to take a piss
We came to party, didn't come to give a shit

I hear these couples fighting all the time, not us
We have a good time, like to get fucked up
What, what, goin' hard tonight
Under twenty one, but find me at the bar tonight
Hey, driving round in my car tonight
Making music that ain't hard to like, I got the heart to write
A couple bars I might go do
Something crazy or maybe lazy, love me or hate me
You know it's the same me
And it goes a little something like this

Young kid who bang drums, money don't you worry I'ma make some
Somebody changin' the world, it only takes one
Never scared of death, but I ain't ready for that day to come
A million people in the world, I don't hate one
Even them dummies robbin' people with some fake guns
Make mistakes young boy, that's just what I heard
And you don't ever figure what you don't want at first
I got another verse, invincible and nothin' hurts
A hundred words coming up with what'll have your bubble burst
We can just fuck, you don't need to take my number first
Gettin' right to it, I ain't really tryna cuddle first
I used to try everything with her, and nothin' worked
Got her backwards like she heard the thunder first
These are the days of our lives, and I ain't lyin' kid
Bein' free, tell me what kind of crime that is
It said it can't let me spit a couple sentences
Always good penmanship, make sure you all remember this
You just entered into Blue Slide Park
The place where dreams comin' true, that's where you find heart
Up until the sun come up, yeah my crew grind hard
See me out throughout the day, but you won't find me in the dark
Say I'm smart with remarks, such remarkable bars
Who knew this music would get me a couple cars
That just sit in park 'cause I'm out somewhere travelin'
Mackin' on the preschool honeys, you were somewhere tattlin'
Mad 'cause been known to always spaz again
Every single track with him, Oh he's just so talented
Dream of countin' money 'til my fingers get some calluses
King with many palaces, a fuckin' golden fork to eat my salad with
I observe, asking what did he design
I see an artificial future for a digital mind
Muhammad Ali, yeah I'm him in his prime
Just that normal kid in class who was sittin' behind
Didn't really pay attention though I'm spittin' his rhymes
But now you see his car, tryin' gettin' inside
No, hell no
I wanna go back home
Late night can't remember what the day's like
Reminiscin' on stop signs and brake lights
'Cause it seems that I'm always on the move
When they gonna let me back home
I wanna go back home
I wanna go back home",213303
